<p class="drop-cap-image"><span class="idcfirst">The</span> individual who puts the most
into life is the one who gets the
most out of life. The first requisite
for making life effective for one’s
self or society is a sound body.
There have been many people who in spite of
weak bodies have enriched the world by noble
thought and work. There has been a long line
of physically weak men who have helped the
world onward; but the rule holds that the best
work has been done by men and women of
vigorous health.</p>

<p>It is important that the Negro race in its present
condition shall learn just as quickly as
possible how to have good, strong, healthy
working bodies, for so much is dependent upon
them. In the world of industry, the world of commerce,
all mental activity and spiritual endeavor,—no
matter in what direction one’s attention
or energies may be turned, strong bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
are needed to meet the demand. There are a
few simple rules which should serve as guide-posts
to those who would make the most of
their physical being. One of the conditions of
a good, strong, working body is contact with
fresh air. In the early days of this school, when
we were housed in shacks and cabins, whatever
else we lacked, we were, by virtue of necessity,
abundantly supplied with air; but now
that we are getting into plastered buildings,
with good floors and windows and doors, there
is danger of suffering from poorly ventilated
rooms and a lack of health-giving air.</p>

<p>Those who live in the large cities would do
well to become disciples of Wordsworth, and
with him learn to know the inspiration and
strength that come from wood and forest,—the
joy of intimate acquaintance with birds and
flowers. The individual who has the privilege of
living on the farm, and coming in contact with
the earth and grass and trees and real things,
is the individual who, provided he has an eye
to see and an ear to hear, is most to be envied.</p>

<p>Next in importance to an abundance of fresh
air is the habit of regular, systematic exercise.
People often think that this kind of exercise
costs a great deal of money, that it means costly
apparatus and artificial fixtures. Not so. It requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
no great outlay of time or energy for the
boy on the farm to breathe deeply as he follows
the plough or scatters the seeds. And yet, simple
exercises of this kind are essential to the
life of a race whose mortality from pulmonary
diseases is alarming. Every boy in the machine
shop knows how necessary it is to keep his
machinery well oiled and in good running condition.
Then, too, every such boy knows the
importance of keeping every part of his machinery
as clean as possible. Now, your body is
a machine, but how much more delicate and
intricate than any made by man! how much
more necessary to keep it in good running condition
and absolutely clean in order that it
may do its best work!</p>

<p>In addition to pure air and cleanliness, I want
to speak of the wearing of comfortable clothing
as another essential to right living. I am glad
to see that the world is fast getting away from
the old habits that used to enslave people in
this matter of dressing—the habit exercised
by many of wearing small shoes, for instance,
until their feet were cramped in severe pains
merely to have the world think they had small
feet. What does it matter to the world whether
a person has small feet or large feet? Who ever
stops to think whether great poets, historians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
the great workers in economic and religious
life,—men and women who have really accomplished
something,—had large or small feet,
whether they wore fours or eights, or wore
large or small corsets or none. I am glad to see
that all peoples and races are getting away from
that kind of thing, and I want the Tuskegee
students to make up their minds to buy shoes
to fit no matter what the number. We consider
the Chinese ridiculous to keep their feet cruelly
cramped in order that they may be small, but
many of us in somewhat less degree are guilty
of the same thing.</p>

<p>The importance of temperance has been repeated
over and over again from this platform;
and intemperance in eating or sleeping is not
less disgusting than intemperance in drink.</p>

<p>The world’s work is to be done by men and
women of vigorous intellect; but the sound
mind must have its foundation in a body which
is kept clean and made comfortable by proper
clothing, pure air, regular exercise and wholesome
food. No workman, however competent,
can do good work unless his tools are kept in
proper repair. My plea is that the young Negro
students shall acquire strong working bodies to
be used as tools to serve therewith their fellows
and their Maker. This is the end of all living.</p>

Most Successful School Life</span></h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap-image"><span class="idcfirst">The</span> student who would put the
most into his school life must
first of all be happy. I do not believe
it is possible for a student
to accomplish very much, certainly
not the most, while he is in school, unless
he learns to be happy in all his relations in
school life. If the students are unhappy there is
something wrong with the institution, or with
the teachers, or with the student body. The
normal state of a student in a well-ordered institution
is a happy one. It is impossible to get
the most out of the life of any institution unless
there is joy in working out the ideals of
the institution. The student should make himself
familiar with the purposes of the school to
which he seeks admission, and having made
the choice, he should be loyal to its traditions
and purposes.</p>

<p>The Bible teaches over and over again that
freedom, without which happiness is impossible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
is self-imposed restraint, that to be really
free we must live within the law. He who lives
outside the law is a slave. The freeman is the
man who lives within the law, whether that law
be the physical or the divine. All life is governed
by law, and the student must acquire freedom
by obedience to law. The students in any institution
are divided into two classes: the happy,
contented, ambitious, hopeful ones, who have
faith in the institution and respect for its traditions,
and the miserable, discontented, grumbling
class. One class live not only within the
letter but in the spirit of the law, and are consequently
happy. The second class are miserable,
discontented and hopeless because they
try to live outside the law. No student can get
much out of any institution who does not enter
whole-heartedly into its spirit, its traditions
and its ideals.</p>

<p>The ability to do hard methodical work is one
of the prizes which every school worthy of the
name offers to its students. The years at school
not infrequently give bent to the whole life.
The student who does slipshod work at school
is more than likely to lack direction in his subsequent
career. But mental strength comes not
as a bequest. It is a prize that must be contended
for right earnestly, and dictionary, cyclopaedia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
text-book and shop are tools which
instructors place in the hands of students to
help them win the prize. The proper use of
these tools must depend finally upon the individual
student. No one gets much out of life
who does not make his education a real, vital
part of himself. Many people have education
very much as a parrot has at his command
a certain number of words or sentences. The
words and sentences that the parrot utters are
no real part of him. They are merely something
tacked on to the parrot, and foreign to his real
natural make-up. Some people use education
as they use their “Sunday clothes,” on extra
occasions only. They bring their education into
play when they are in the company of others,
commit a few quotations and use big words
which have no working place in their vocabulary.
To try to make education a real part of
one’s self is the way to get most out of one’s
school life. Just as the food a man eats becomes
a part of his blood and bone, so should education
become a vital part of him. Education
must be digested and assimilated in order to
make it significant.</p>

<p>The student who leaves undone immediate
duties because of bodily laziness is leaving
happiness far behind him. Sins of commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and sins of omission alike tend to weakness.
Our ability to make the world better depends
entirely upon our ability to use every opportunity
to make ourselves better. A largeness
of life, a variety of interests and breadth of view
are among the prizes which a school offers to
its students. These qualities the ignorant man
does not possess. Largeness of life and breadth
of vision give faith in the future; that largeness
makes one person take the long view when
the other is taking the short view; that largeness
lifts the educated person far above the
temptation to gossip about little things, above
the temptation to get down into the mud
and slime with which weaker individuals are
smeared.</p>

<p>To be loyal and obedient to the legislation of
an institution, to make thrifty use of text-book
and shop and farm and every part of the school
equipment, is to attain that mental strength
that makes for largeness of life and breadth of
view. These qualities come not by observation,
but they do come by conscientious work in season
and out of season. They are all within the
reach of the student who is willing to work for
them, and they are all essential to real happiness.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap-image"><span class="idcfirst">The</span> large problem of the teacher
is not to impart knowledge and
maintain discipline. The larger
problem is to bring school life and
real life into closer contact. With
the average teacher, as with the average student,
there is very little connection between
the school and life as it is actually lived every
day outside the school-room; and as long as
this is true there will be ground for reasonable
and just criticism.</p>

<p>In the primary school, the intermediary school
and the high school there is often little, if
any, connection between life as it is lived in the
shop, on the farm, in business and in the home.
It cannot but prove of mutual advantage if the
teacher can bring school life into actual touch
with the life of the people about him. The interest
of the parents will be increased just in
proportion as they find that the teacher is
making his instruction stimulate and vitalize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
conditions outside the school-room.</p>

<p>It is difficult for the parent of the country
child to note the results of education through
the usual processes and channels of knowledge.
Colored parents depend upon seeing the
results of education in ways not true of the
white parent. It is important then that the colored
teacher in this generation should give
special attention to bringing school life into
closer touch with real life. Any education is to
my mind “high” which enables the individual
to do the very best work for the people by
whom he is surrounded. Any education is “low”
that does not make for character and effective
service.</p>

<p>The average teacher in the public schools is
very likely to yield to the temptation of thinking
that he is educating an individual when he is
teaching him to reason out examples in Arithmetic,
to prove propositions in Geometry and
to recite pages of History. He conceives this to
be the end of education. Herein is the sad deficiency
in many teachers who are not able to
use History, Arithmetic, Geometry as means
to an end. They get the idea that the student
who has mastered a certain number of pages
in a text-book is educated, forgetting that text-books
are at best but tools, and in many cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
ineffective tools, for the development of man.
Modern educators are getting more and more
away from books. Now this will be hard for
the average teacher who has worked out all
the problems in Arithmetic and proved them by
the answers in the book, but I believe that
the best educational thought tends toward the
study of real things and not mere books.</p>

<p>One of the ways of bringing the school into
closer touch with society is to make school surroundings,
including the grounds and buildings,
as homelike and as attractive as possible.
The school-rooms are in too many cases cold
and barren. In schools of this sort there is little
connection between the home and the school. I
believe that the teacher should study the home
surroundings of his pupils and become more
intimately acquainted with the parents. When
teachers are able to make their school-rooms
inviting and are able to project their influence
into the home life of the pupils, there will be
few absentees or truants. A child cannot be expected
to leave a comfortable, attractive and
convenient home to go into a dull, inconvenient,
uncomfortable school-room, nor can it be expected
that pupils will leave comfortable chairs
at home and go into school-rooms where they
must sit on stools with their feet six or eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
inches from the floor.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the teacher
should set the example for the student in the
matter of cleanliness and neatness. The teacher
who would preach against grease spots, rents
in clothes and buttonless jackets must see to
it that he is himself without fault in these respects.
When I go into a school and notice that
the instructor has buttons off his coat, I am at
once convinced that he is not the right teacher.
I do not believe that there is much that the
student can learn at that school that can be
put into practice in real life. I believe that the
teacher should not only set an example himself,
but that he should go further than this:
he should see that every boy and girl in his
school is familiar with the practical applications
of soap and water, and knows the work
of the tooth-brush and the darning-needle.
Some parents may at first resent this encroachment
upon their special domain, but persistence
in an endeavor of this sort will finally
cause the parents to look upon the teacher as
a new force in the community. The average
parent cannot appreciate how many examples
Johnny has worked that day, how many questions
in History he has answered; but when he
says, “Mother, I cannot go back to that school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
until all the buttons are sewed on my coat,”
the parent will at once become conscious of
school influence in the home. This will be the
best kind of advertisement. The button propaganda
tends to make the teacher a power in
the community. A few lessons in applied Chemistry
will not be amiss. Take grease spots, for
example. The teacher who with tact can teach
his pupils to keep even threadbare clothes
neatly brushed and free from grease spots is
extending the school influence into the home
and is adding immeasurably to the self-respect
of the home.</p>

<p>In the school-houses in the city, and in many
of the larger towns and country districts, janitors
do all the work of cleaning. This may
be necessary in city schools, where it is not
possible for the children to do all the work of
beautifying and cleaning the school building,
but when all this work is done by outsiders
the children are robbed of part of their instruction
and they thus lose a very important lesson
in cleanliness and order which it is the duty of
the teacher to give. Think of the time lost in
the average family looking for the broom when
the time comes to sweep the floor. At this time
all business suspends. Mother cries out first,
“Where is the broom?” The older sister cries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
to John and Susie and Jane, “Where is the
broom?” and that kind of thing goes on every
day in the week and year. It takes the average
family from ten to twelve minutes every day to
find the broom. Now, we should teach a different
lesson in our schools. We can teach in the
first place that there are two ways for the
broom to be put up, a proper and an improper
way. We can teach the children that there is a
place for the dust-pan and the dust-cloth and
the match-box. The match-box is another thing
that suspends business. Every night when the
matches are wanted, everything goes helter-skelter.
This is a larger problem than the
broom, there being absolutely no light on the
subject. The children should be taught that
there must be a definite place for the broom
and for the match-box, and it is surprising how
quickly these lessons will be taken from the
school-room into the home. Even the listless
parents will be roused to interest by such practical
teaching. The child who goes to school in
a room that is clean and attractive will not long
be content to live in a home that is dirty and
disorderly.</p>

<p>I was recently in a school-room in South Carolina.
The teacher had a reputation for being
a well-fitted instructor, and I expected much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of him. He was teaching the children by the
latest methods. The children sang well, they
recited their lessons well, but the fact that one
third of the plastering was missing made the
greatest impression on me. I could not detect
the slightest attempt on the part of the teacher
or students to see that the plastering was restored.
I should have suspended school a day
or two until the plastering could be replaced,
rather than teach day after day by silent approval
a lesson of disorder. If the teacher is
careless, the pupils will accept his standards
and go through life in an indifferent, slipshod
manner. If from the first day they enter school
they are surrounded with object lessons of order
and cleanliness, more will have been done
to educate them in a large and helpful way
than if they had centred their interest in books
alone.</p>

<p>Order and beauty are sacrificed in many of our
schools because one third or one fourth of the
window-glass is out. Sometimes I have seen
obsolete hats and discarded dresses doing duty
in the absence of window-glass or window-panes
knocked out in order that the stovepipe
might be run through the broken place. The
child never outlives the impression made by
such a sight. The parents will join their children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in helping to patch broken plastering if
the teacher will take the lead. When the plastering
is mended, a few pictures should be
placed on the walls, and in this work the parents’
coöperation can be depended upon. Teachers
must put not less conscience but more
thought into the work for the children to whose
lives they are giving direction. By putting into
their work more of their better selves, more
of their personality, teachers will add not only
to their own happiness and usefulness, but will
be doing real work toward hastening the coming
of that kingdom for which they daily pray.</p>

<span class="subhead">Industrial Efficiency an Aid to
The Higher Life</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="idc">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_017i.png" width="422" height="422" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap-image i"><span class="idcfirst">It</span> was Emerson who said that
“One generation clears the forests,
the next builds the palaces.”
Each generation is very anxious
to engage in the building of the
palaces, an ambition which is altogether laudable,
but the forests must first be cleared or
there will be no palaces. And so it falls to the
lot of every successful individual of every race
and nation to engage at some time or period
in their existence in dealing in a large degree
with the industrial or material affairs of life.</p>

<p>The forms of industry that occupy the majority
of people in a civilized country may be
classed under one of the following heads: first
and perhaps most largely, the production of raw
material in one form or another; the second
step is the manufacturing of these materials;
third, the problem of transportation and getting
these products on the markets of the
world, and having them properly distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and economically and wisely consumed.</p>

<p>The production of cotton in the South presents
a familiar example of all these processes.
The growing of cotton is an industry largely
in the hands of my race; in the second step,
the manufacturing of cotton, the colored people
have as yet little part; in putting these
materials on the market through the medium
of steamboats, steam-cars, and their distribution
through wholesale and retail establishments,
colored people have diminishing interests.
The lesson for all young people to learn
in this busy industrial age is to deal with materials,
whether at first hand in getting something
out of the soil, or as constructing or distributing
agents, so as to increase the value of
the material they handle and to make themselves
more useful as individuals.</p>

<p>The main source of all productiveness is in
the soil, and the work of getting out of the soil
all that can be gotten out of it has, in recent
years, made agriculture an intellectual pursuit.
It is very important to note the progress
of the world during the last few years, when
people have learned to put more into life by
putting brains and skill and confidence into
all industrial operations. A few years ago the
man who was going to be a farmer made almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
no preparation for his work. Skill and intelligence
were not considered necessary, but
to-day in every civilized country there are institutions
that have for their sole purpose the
teaching of methods of getting everything possible
out of the soil. A few years ago the mining
of coal, copper, silver and gold was left to
the most unintelligent, ignorant and unskilled
people; there was little thought or skill put
into preparation for this kind of work. To-day
mining schools have been established in all important
mining districts, and this industry has
been so dignified that intelligent and skilful
men delight to enter it. The same thing is true
of forestry. Within the last few months a chair
of Forestry has been established at Cornell
University, where young men can learn all
about the selection and cultivation of trees. The
Department of Agriculture at Washington is
spending over two million dollars yearly in
showing people how to take care of the forests.
The world is making all the material products
serve not as masters but as servants, and servants
in the sense that they are making people
put more thought, more effort, more skill into
life, and enabling them thus to get more abundant
returns wherewith to enlarge and ennoble
their lives. There are opportunities about us on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
every hand. The Southern farm offers great opportunities
to every young man who will use his
talents. The idea that farming means ploughing
with one mule or digging the ground with
a spade is fast disappearing, for this industry
is developing into a high and dignified calling.
Young women of maturer races than ours are
making large economic successes in the raising
of chickens, in fruit growing, in raising
small berries; and young colored women should
begin to get some of the benefits of these industries.</p>

<p>But the chance for material success in connection
with industrial life is relatively of less
importance than is the chance for the individual
to get development through the mastering
of difficulties in the management of industrial
operations. The mere mastering of these difficulties
has made many of the Captains of Industry
of this country. Poverty discourages
many a youth who starts out in the busy industrial
world, but the fact that others have
conquered poverty is an earnest that others,
for centuries to come, will get courage and
strength out of adverse struggle. The colored
man starts out, it is true, with an additional
handicap, but here is the chance for Negro
youth to learn to turn disadvantages to advantages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
A colored man born in poverty and an ex-slave
owns to-day one of the largest tailoring
establishments in one of the most prominent
streets in the city of Boston. This man had
learned the sweet uses of adversity and knew
how to lay hold of disadvantages. His establishment
is patronized by people who buy from
him not in spite of the fact that he is a Negro,
but because he is a Negro. The world needs
men, be they white or black, who can rise on
successive failures to useful citizenship. No
person can enter industrial life without for a
time feeling some days of almost complete failure,
but mistakes and weariness beget confidence
and experience.</p>

<p>All industrial operations and material progress
should be used not as ends but as means
of making life more comfortable, more useful
and more beautiful. The intelligent farmer as
he plants and works and harvests the cotton
must remember that the production of cotton
is not the end of his effort. Every bale of cotton
can be turned into books, into opportunities for
travel and study. The man who grows corn
must remember that the growing of corn is not
the end of life, but that the corn can be turned
into refinements and beauties of a civilized life
and a Christian home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>No one can doubt that the people who have
built the railroads and constructed the great
steamships that bind country to country have
added to the wealth and happiness of the
world. Finally, it must be remembered that the
mastering of difficulties should bring poise,
purpose and vision. I want every Tuskegee
student as he finds his place in the surging
industrial life about him to give heed to the
things which are “honest and just and pure
and of good report,” for these things make for
character, which is the only thing worth fighting
for, either in this life or the next.</p>

<span class="subhead">Making Religion
A Vital Part of Living</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="idc">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_023e.png" width="421" height="421" alt="E" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap-image e"><span class="idcfirst">Educated</span> men and women, especially
those who are in college
or other institutions of learning,
very often get the idea that religion
is fit only for the common
people and beneath the interest and sympathy
of the educated man. In too many cases they
are disposed to think that religion is for the
weak, and that to express doubts concerning
religion and the future life is an indication of
a vigorous, independent mind. No young man
or woman can make a greater error than this.</p>

<p>Some years ago, when I was in New York
City, I went down to Wall Street to consult a
friend as to methods of arranging for a large
meeting. I wanted in this meeting to get interest
centred in the work we are trying to do at
Tuskegee. My friend said: “If you can secure
the coöperation of four men in New York City,
the success of your meeting will be assured.”
I went to the four men whose names had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
given me and secured their interest and coöperation.
Some weeks later there was a large
meeting held in New York in the interest of
the Young Men’s Christian Association movement.
In looking over the list of persons who
were sponsors for this meeting I found the
names of the four men whom my Wall Street
friend had mentioned. He gave me these
names, however, with no thought that they
were leaders in the religious activity of New
York City. He named them chiefly because
he knew their standing in the commercial and
business life of the city was secure, and that
anything they said would attract the attention
of the public and would secure the confidence
of the people whose interest and aid we were
seeking. And so it appears that the four men
who at that time represented the commercial
and business interest of New York were men
who were closely identified with the religious
life of the city, and were active in Sunday-school
and church work, and connected with
many other agencies which had to do with the
uplifting of the masses. My observation has
taught me that the people who stand for the
most in the educational and commercial world
and in the uplifting of the people are in some
real way connected with the religious life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the people among whom they reside.</p>

<p>This being true we ought to make the most
of our religious life and to avail ourselves of
certain outward helps, helps which are not
ends but aids to higher spiritual living. First
the habit of regular attendance at some religious
service should be cultivated. This is one
of the outward helps toward inward grace. Nothing
is ever lost by this habit of systematic
devotion. But one says, “What good is accomplished
by attending church?” Another says,
“I stay away from religious service and I am
just as good as those who go.” To put the
question another way, Was any one ever injured
by regular attendance upon religious services?
The man who allows himself to grow
careless about sacred things yields to a temptation
which is sure to drag him down. As you
value your spiritual life, see to it that you do
not lose the spirit of reverence for the Most
High as revealed in your own life and experience,
reverence for the Most High as revealed
in the men and women about you, in the
opening flower, the setting sun, and the song
of the bird. Do not mistake denominationalism
for reverence and religion. Religion is life,
denominationalism is an aid to life.</p>

<p>Systematic reading and prayerful study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the Bible is the second outward help which I
would commend to those whom I wish to see
make the most of their spiritual life. Many people
regard the Bible as a wonderful piece of
literature only. The reading of the Bible as literature
only brings its reward in that it throws
new light on secular history and gives acquaintance
with men and women and ideals which
have been the inspiration of the noblest things
that have ever been spoken or written. Nowhere
in all literature can be found a finer bit
of oratory than St. Paul’s defence before King
Agrippa. But praiseworthy as this kind of
study is, I do not believe it is sufficient. The
Bible should be read as a daily guide to right
living and as a daily incentive to positive Christian
service.</p>

<p>I think that no man who lives a merely negative
religious life can ever know real spiritual
joy. There are many people who pride themselves
on the things they do not do. The negative
Christian always suggests a lamp-post to
me. The negative Christian says he is going to
heaven because he does not lie. Neither does
the lamp-post. The negative Christian does not
steal. Neither does the lamp-post steal. He does
not cheat, he does nothing of which he is
ashamed: he is therefore blameless. The lamp-post<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
has never done any one of these things. I
do not want the Tuskegee students to be lamp-posts
in their religious life, but I want them to
turn their beliefs into energy that shall work
into every detail of their lives.</p>

<p>Not less repulsive to me than the negative
Christian is the one who is always using his
religion as a means of escape from something,
from hell fire or brimstone or some less remote
punishment. This class of Christians use religion
as people use the conjurer’s bag or a disinfectant
to ward off evil. They are not drawn
to any vital thing in religion; they simply use
it as a cloak to shield them from harm.</p>

<p>To live the real religious life is in some measure
to share the character of God. The word
“atonement,” which occurs in the Bible again
and again, means literally at-one-ment. To be
at one with God is to be like God. Our real religious
striving, then, should be to become one
with God, sharing with Him in our poor human
way His qualities and attributes. To do this,
we must get the inner life, the heart right, and
we shall then become strong where we have
been weak, wise where we have been foolish.
We are often criticised as a race because people
say that our religion is not real. They say
that our religion is superficial, that in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
our attendance at religious services and protestations
of faith we are guilty of petty pilfering,
stealing, lying and of walking crookedly
in many directions. Whenever this criticism is
true it means that we have not learned what
the religious life really means. We must learn
to incorporate God’s laws into our thoughts
and words and acts. Frequent reference is made
in the Bible to the freedom that comes from
being a Christian. A man is free just in proportion
as he learns to live within God’s laws,
and he makes grievous mistakes and serious
blunders the minute he departs from these
laws.</p>

<p>As a race we are inclined, I fear, to make too
much of the day of judgment. We have the
idea that in some far-off period there is going
to be a great and final day of judgment, when
every individual will be called up, and all his
bad deeds will be read out before him and all
his good deeds made known. I believe that
every day is a day of judgment, that we reap
our rewards daily, and that whenever we sin
we are punished by mental and physical anxiety
and by a weakened character that separates
us from God. Every day is, I take it, a
day of judgment, and as we learn God’s laws
and grow into His likeness we shall find our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
reward in this world in a life of usefulness and
honor. To do this is to have found the kingdom
of God, which is the kingdom of character
and righteousness and peace.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap-image i"><span class="idcfirst">In</span> the Bible one finds over and
over again the words “a peculiar
people.” Reference is made to the
Jews as “a peculiar people,”—a
people differing in thought and
temperament and mode of life from others by
whom they were surrounded. Now the race to
which Americans of African lineage belong is
often described as “a peculiar people,” having
had, as we know, a peculiar history. They differ
in color and in appearance, and in a very large
degree their temperament and thought differ
from that of the people about them. Now the
Jews because they were different from the peoples
by whom they were surrounded, because
of their peculiar religious bent, were able to
give to the world the doctrine of the unity and
Fatherhood of God, and Christianity, the finest
flower of Jewry. It is then, I think, not too
much to hope that the very qualities which
make the Negro different from the peoples by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
whom he is surrounded will enable him, in the
fulness of time, to make a peculiar contribution
to the nation of which he forms a part.</p>

<p>What that contribution is to be no man can
now tell, but we must keep in mind that the
race is made of individuals and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“every man God made</div>

</div>

<p class="in0">As with an individual, so with a race. When
you and I and all the other individuals that go
to make up our race shall have learned to do
well our own peculiar work, we shall be able
to determine the bent of the race. It must fall
upon you and me, who have had opportunity
to work out in some measure our own individual
problems, to give direction to the race. It
is for us, therefore, to bring to the enrichment
of our lives, as individuals, every quality which
we are capable of cultivating.</p>

<p>There is in the New Testament a passage
which I like to refer to and to think of; it reads
something like this: “He that overcometh shall
be clothed in white raiment.” The expression
“He that overcometh” occurs several times in
the New Testament. I am anxious that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Tuskegee students shall get the idea firmly
fixed in their minds that there are definite rewards
coming to the individual or to the race
that overcomes obstacles and succeeds in spite
of seemingly insurmountable difficulties. The
palms of victory are not for the race that merely
complains and frets and rails. I do not mean
to say that there is not a place for race loyalty
and enthusiasm. There is a proper and vital
place for protests against the wrongs that are
inflicted without cause or reason. Every race,
like every individual, should be swift to protest
against injustice and wrongs, but no race must
be content with mere protests. Every race
must show to the world by tangible, visible, indisputable
evidence that it can do more than
merely call attention to the wrongs inflicted
upon it. The reward of life is for those who
choose the good where evil calls out on every
hand. That reward is moral character. The
more temptations resisted—the more difficult
the struggle—the more robust the character.
The wholly innocent person is much less
praiseworthy than is he who has faced temptation
and has come out of it unscarred. The
virtues of foresight and thrift and frugality,
brought bravely to the front, will bring large
material possessions which if properly used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
will refine and enrich life.</p>

<p>I am constrained to refer once more to that
“peculiar people,” the Jews,—a race that has
been handicapped in very much the same way
as the colored people. Their opportunities have
been limited in many directions. In Russia
to-day they are in many cases debarred from
schools and from entrance into the professions.
And, notwithstanding the barriers in this country,
one of the most noted banking firms in the
United States is composed of Jews. Members
of a despised race, they made up their minds
that in spite of difficulties they would not stop
to complain, but would compel recognition by
making a real contribution to the country of
which they formed a part. The Japanese race is
a convincing example of the respect which the
world gives to a race that can put brains and
commercial activity into the development of the
resources of a country. What material difficulties
the thrifty Hollanders have had to overcome
in the development of their country! But
the battle against water and wind has developed
not only a country, but an energetic, thrifty
people. The Netherlands have literally been
made by these sturdy Hollanders, who because
they overcame are looked upon as a great and
happy people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>There is, then, opportunity for the colored people
to enrich the material life of their adopted
country by doing what their hands find to do,
minor duties though they be, so well that nobody
else of any race can do them better. This
is the aim that the Tuskegee student should
keep steadily before him. If he remembers that
all service, however lowly, is true service, an
important step will have been taken in the solution
of what we term “the race problem.”</p>

<p>For it must be remembered that no individual
of any race can contribute to the solution of
any general problem until he has first worked
out his own peculiar problem. Some months
ago I met a former schoolmate whom I had not
seen for a number of years. I was naturally interested
to hear about his progress, and began
to question him. I asked him where he lived,
and he said he had no abiding-place, in fact he
had lived in a half dozen places since we parted.
In answer to other questions, I found that he
had no special trade, no special business, no
bank account. I asked then what he had been
doing in the intervening years, and he answered
he had been travelling about over the country,
doing his best to solve the race problem. That
man should rather have been at work at the
solution of his own individual problem. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
individual circumstanced as he was could
not solve anybody’s problem. It is important to
have one’s own dooryard clean before calling
attention to the imperfection in the neighbor’s
yard. Each Negro can put much into the life
of his race by making his own individual life
present a model in purity and patience, in industry
and courage, in showing the world how
to get strength out of difficulties. The late
President Garfield once said that no person
ever drowned, no matter how many times he
was thrown overboard, who was worth saving,
and that remark, with a few modifications,
might be applied to a race. No race is ever lost
that is worth saving, and no race need be
lost that wants to save itself. The world is full
of little people who through lack of wisdom
and patience and perseverance merely add to
the world’s burdens. The despised Negro has
the chance to show to the world that charity
which suffereth long and is kind and which
never faileth. In the face of discouragements and
difficulties the Negro must ever remember
that nobody can degrade him. Nobody can degrade
a big race or a big man. No one can degrade
a single member of any race. The individual
himself is the only one who can inflict
that punishment. Frederick Douglass was on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
one occasion compelled to ride for several hours
in a portion of a freight car. A friend went into
the freight car to console him and said to him
that he hated to see a man of his intelligence in
so humiliating a position. “I am ashamed that
they have thus degraded you.” But Douglass,
straightening himself up in his seat, looked the
friend in the face and said, “They cannot degrade
Frederick Douglass.” And so they cannot
degrade a single individual who does not
want to be degraded. Injustice cannot work
harm upon the oppressed without injuring the
oppressor. The Negro people must live the
precepts taught by the Christ. They must go on
multiplying, day by day, deeds of worthiness,
piling them up mountain high. And just as you
and I, as individuals, are called upon to serve
the race of which we are a part, so let us as a
race recognize the fact that we are a part of a
great nation which we are bound to serve.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
